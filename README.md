# KIOST

Scripts for applying PCA/SVM to data from the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) Oil Type Analysis (OTA) project.

'ML_test_script_iterable' uses a grid-search to determine the best SVM parameters for the dataset.

'ML_test_script_detailed' can be used to input specific parameters and output more detailed information about that model.

In order to run these with the datasets that are being referenced, download the .csv files and change the filepath in the script to match the destination on your machine.
